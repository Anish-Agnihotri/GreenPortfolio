# Synopsis & Inspiration
GreenPortfolio is built as a portfolio website based on Dribbble icon mockups that caught my eye. The portfolio is fully responsive, and built with PUG/SASS (that can be compiled to HTML/CSS). It's currently got a landing page, two information pages, and an in-development contact page.
